TPXO7.2 Load Tide Model: Notes

Very briefly and this is almost all I can say - I have 
Richard Ray's code which I just run for a given global 
ocean tide model. These load calculations require evaluation 
of convolution integrals over the sphere, supported by an 
ancient "SPHEREPACK" package. I believe the right 
references for these procedure are:

Ray RD, Sanchez BV (1989) Radial deformation of the Earth 
by oceanic tidal loading, NASA Technical Memorandum 100743, 
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt

numerical tidal models. Mar Geodesy 21(3):181–192
